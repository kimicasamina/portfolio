                Iâ€™m a self-taught developer with a passion for solving
                real-world problems through programming and software
                development. Over the years, Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation in
                full-stack development, with a primary focus on the MERN stack
                (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Along the way, Iâ€™ve
                expanded my skill set by diving into other powerful back-end
                frameworks such as Django and Laravel as well as working with
                relational databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. I enjoy the
                challenge of building both the front-end and back-end of
                applications, integrating them seamlessly, whether itâ€™s building
                user interfaces, creating data models, developing APIs, or
                deploying to the server.

              <p className="text-sm">
                My journey as a developer is driven by a deep curiosity and a
                desire to find my place in the world, where I can grow, evolve
                and contribute in a meaningful way. Iâ€™m always looking to
                improve my skills through personal projects and hands-on
                experience. I enjoy experimenting with new tools, exploring best
                practices, and methodologies to refine my development process.

              <p className="text-sm">
                Beyond just coding, I am passionate about solving complex
                problems and transforming ideas into practical solutions.
                Whether itâ€™s building responsive front-end interfaces or
                architecting back-end systems, I approach each project with a
                focus on quality and long-term growth. My ultimate goal is to
                contribute meaningfully to a collaborative and dynamic
                development team, where I can continue to grow both
                professionally and personally, while tackling challenging and
                rewarding projects.

                In my free time, youâ€™ll often find me enjoying the sun, whether
                itâ€™s soaking up a peaceful afternoon outside or relishing the
                gentle, warm breeze and golden glow of a sunset.
